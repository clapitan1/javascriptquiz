# javascriptquiz

I used https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/default.asp as a base guideline to create my quiz and find questions to use for it
I used console.log to check if data was inputting
I used inspect element to check my errors
I used stack overflow when I would get stuck on a javascript error
